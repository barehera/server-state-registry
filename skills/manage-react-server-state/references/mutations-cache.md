# Mutations and cache

## Mutation ownership

Follow the project's public API style. A mutation hook normally owns `useMutation`, calls the transport operation, obtains the QueryClient, and applies the endpoint's actual cache effects. Separate reusable cache actions when more than one mutation or workflow needs them; keep a simple one-off update local when extraction adds no clarity.

Use the backend result and mutation variables. Do not broadly invalidate every resource by habit.

## Cache semantics

- `set`: write a complete value when the response is sufficient.
- `patch`: merge partial data into an existing value; do not seed an invalid entity.
- `invalidate`: mark affected queries stale and optionally refetch according to Query policy.
- `remove`: erase cache entries after deletion or loss of access.
- `delete`: reserve for the network mutation.

Build cache identities through the same key source as reads. Account for finite, infinite, filtered, detail, and context caches as different shapes.

## Choosing mutation effects

Derive effects from the contract and UX:

- Create: seed detail only if a complete entity is returned; invalidate or patch relevant collections.
- Update: set detail from a complete response or patch known fields; refresh collections whose sorting/filter membership may change.
- Delete: remove detail and update/invalidate collections and dependent contexts.
- Relationship mutation: update/invalidate the relationship context and any count displayed elsewhere.

Ask when business behavior is unknowable, such as whether an update changes list membership or whether the backend returns a complete entity.

## Optimistic updates

Use optimistic state only when the interaction benefits and rollback is well-defined:

1. Cancel the exact affected queries.
2. Snapshot every shape that will change.
3. Apply the smallest optimistic change.
4. Restore snapshots on error, including valid empty/falsy data.
5. Reconcile with the server result or targeted invalidation.

Do not copy one optimistic recipe across detail, filtered list, and infinite pages.

Prefer existing project-wide error reporting. Do not introduce a toast, logging, or translation dependency inside reusable server-state code without a project requirement.
